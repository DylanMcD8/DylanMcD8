# Hey there! üëãüèª  I'm Dylan, a Swift developer from New York.

### I am the developer of a few apps, such as [School Assistant](https://sunapps.org/sa). My profile may look kinda empty, but that's just because many of my repos are private. You can see more about my company at its website, [sunapps.org](https://sunapps.org). Or, you can learn more about me and see some personal projects and articles at my website, [dylanmcd.com](https://dylanmcd.com). I am also a Swift Student Challange winner (2025)! Currently, I am working as a Mobile iOS Engineer Co-op at [ADUSA](https://adusa.com).
